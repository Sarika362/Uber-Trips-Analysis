# Uber-Trips-Analysis
Analyzing Uber trips can provide valuable insights into ride patterns, helping optimize services and improve customer experiences. In this project, we will analyze Uber ride data to detect patterns and relationships between different variables using Python. 

## Task: Uber Trips Analysis

## Objective: Analyze Uber rides to detect patterns and relationships between different variables using Python.

## Dataset Link:  https://365datascience.com/resources/downloadables/Python-Projects-Uber-Trips-Analysis.zip

###NOTE: These are some sample datasets that you can refer to, you can use different ones for your tasks.

## Tasks:

1. Read the dataset and display records to understand its structure.
2. Uncover hidden patterns in the data using data analysis techniques.
3. Identify relationships between variables such as date, time, location, and ride demand.
4. Visualize the relationships through graphs and charts. 

## Deliverables:

1. Report on Uber trips analysis, including data loading, exploration, and pattern detection.
2. Data visualizations illustrating the discovered relationships.
3. Python code for data analysis and visualization.

## Learning Outcomes:

1. Data handling and exploration in Python.
2. Data analysis to find patterns and trends.
3. Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Understanding relationships between different variables in the dataset.
